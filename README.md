# The Magic of Di$ney

## Motivation for the Project
As many enthusiasts, I have enjoyed Disney films since I was a child. As a parent, I continue to enjoy the content on my own and with my family. I watched documentaries on the history of Disney studios and wondered how this history correlated to the business decisions and revenue generation of the studio.
